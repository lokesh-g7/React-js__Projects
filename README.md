# 🔐 React JS Firebase Authentication App

A modern single-page application (SPA) built using **React JS** that handles **user authentication** with login, registration, and dashboard features. Once logged in, the user is shown their unique **Firebase ID Token**, demonstrating seamless authentication and token management.

This project showcases the power of React's component-based architecture with Firebase backend integration, making it ideal for learning how real-world authentication flows work.
